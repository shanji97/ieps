# Web Information Extraction and Retrieval

Web information extraction and retrieval

The main objective of this course is to learn about information retrieval and search from large corpuses of documents. An important example of such corpus is the World wide web with billions of documents. We will learn techniques and approaches for web crawling, information retrieval, indexing, searching of hidden web, extraction of information etc. Students who will pass the course should be able to develop programs for automatic web search and structured data extraction from web pages (including search and extraction from on-line social media).
